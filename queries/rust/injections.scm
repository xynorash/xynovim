; Base of the rust injections: shadows nvim-treesitter's own queries/rust/injections.scm
; (this directory comes first on the runtimepath; the first file that does not
; extend becomes the base) and is a copy of it with ONE change: the first
; pattern, which parses every macro's token_tree as Rust, skips the sqlx query
; macros. Left in, that nested Rust layer painted the SQL string as @string on
; top of the SQL layer (same priority, drawn later), so `query!` SQL showed as
; one string colour although it was injected. The price: the other arguments of
; those macros (`Row` in query_as!) get no Rust highlighting. The SQL injection
; itself is in after/queries/rust/injections.scm.
